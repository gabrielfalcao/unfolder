It starts with Monte-carlo binary trees depicted as willow trees representing adversarial artificial neural networks where each neural net is a tree. There are three trees, owned by the companies: Google, Amazon and Apple (respectively). The trees emit shimmering photons against each other where such lights represent information being transfered between trees. From there until the end, the three trees fight each other with attacks where information is both the attack and the defence.
